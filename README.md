# Terraform
Terraform Codes
Terraform is a powerful open source tool for building, changing, and versioning your infrastructure deployments in a safely and efficient manner. Terraform can be used to manage existing infrastructures, popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions and implementations. Terraform uses configuration files which describes the components needed to run a single application or your entire datacenter, and desired state will be effected.

we will be deploying terraform to automate instance creation on OpenStack Cloud platform. The OpenStack can be on self-hosted infrastructure or a public managed service offering. All that is required is OpenStack API endpoint that can be accessed from the machine where terraform is installed.
